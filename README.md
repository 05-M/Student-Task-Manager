Student Task Manager is a modern Android application built as part of an intensive personal challenge to rebuild strong Android development fundamentals using the latest Android stack. The goal of this project is to simulate a real-world task management app while applying clean architecture principles and modern development practices.

This app allows students (or any user) to manage daily tasks in a simple, fast, and reliable way. Tasks are stored locally using Room Database, and the UI is built entirely with Jetpack Compose following a state-driven approach.

The project focuses on understanding how real Android apps are structured, how data flows from the database to the UI, and how state is properly managed inside Compose.

Technologies used in this project include Kotlin as the main programming language, Jetpack Compose for building a fully declarative UI, MVVM architecture to separate concerns and keep the code maintainable, Room Database for local data persistence, ViewModel for state management and lifecycle awareness, and Jetpack Navigation for moving between screens.

Main features of the application include adding new tasks with a title, displaying tasks in a dynamic list, saving tasks locally on the device, navigating between multiple screens, and reactive UI updates based on state changes.

This project was built as part of a one-month challenge to prepare for Android internships and strengthen practical skills. Each feature was implemented with learning in mind, focusing on understanding how things work internally rather than just making them run.

Future improvements planned for the project include task editing functionality, task priority levels, search and filtering, UI/UX polishing and animations, and possibly cloud sync in later versions.

To run the project, simply clone the repository, open it using Android Studio, let Gradle sync, and run the app on an emulator or physical device.
